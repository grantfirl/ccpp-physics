/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the scientific documentation for the physical parameterizations available in the  <a href="https://ufscommunity.org/about/what-is-ufs/">Unified Forecast System (UFS)</a> Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application version 2.1.0 (available through https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/) and the suites that can be configured using them. The SRW app targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a 
limited spatial domain and on time scales from less than an hour out to several days. 

The CCPP parameterizations are aggregated in suites by the host models. In this release, the UFS Short-Range Weather Application 2.1.0 
supports suites:
- \ref GFS_v16_page
- \ref HRRR_suite_page
- \ref RRFS_v1beta_page 
- \ref WoFS_v0_page
