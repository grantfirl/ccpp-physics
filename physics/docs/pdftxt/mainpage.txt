/**
\mainpage Introduction 

Welcome to the scientific documentation for the parameterizations available in the Common 
Community Physics Package (CCPP) v6.0.0 and the suites that can be configured using them.

The CCPP-Physics (available through https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics/) is envisioned to contain parameterizations used in the 
<a href="https://ufscommunity.org/about/what-is-ufs/">Unified Forecast System (UFS)</a>
applications for weather through seasonal prediction timescales, encompassing the current operational GFS schemes, as well as 
developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming operational implementations. The UFS can be configured for multiple 
applications, including the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application (available through https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/), 
which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a 
limited spatial domain and on time scales from less than an hour out to several days, and the UFS Medium-Range Weather (MRW) 
Application (available through https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-mrweather-app/), which  targets predictions of global atmospheric 
behavior out to about two weeks.


The CCPP parameterizations are aggregated in suites by the host models. In this release, the CCPP Single Column Model (SCM), developed 
by the Development Testbed Center (DTC), supports suites: 
- \ref GFS_v16_page
- \ref GFS_v17_p8_page
- \ref HRRR_suite_page
- \ref RRFS_v1beta_page
- \ref WoFS_v0_page 
- \ref rap_suite_page 

while the UFS Short-Range Weather Application 2.0 supports suites \ref GFS_v16_page, \ref HRRR_suite_page, \ref RRFS_v1beta_page and 
\ref WoFS_v0_page.

New schemes and capability highlights in this release:
- \ref NSSLMICRO_page
- \ref GFS_UNIFIED_UGWP and \ref GFS_drag_suite
- \ref SFC_MYNNSFL
- \ref ca_page
- \ref GFS_SPP

In this website you will find documentation on various aspects of each 
parameterization, including a high-level overview of its function, the input/output argument list, 
and a description of the algorithm. 
More details about this and other CCPP releases may be found on the
<a href="https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp"> CCPP website </a> hosted by
DTC.
